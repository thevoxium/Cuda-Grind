Following the kernels in the PMPP book for the Cuda Challenge by Umar Jamil

#### Day 1
File : vecadd.cu
Details: Implemented the simple vector addition kernel shown in the first chapter of PMPP book. 
Learned:
- Function Declarations (global, device, host)
- Kernel Call & Grid Launch (<<<>>>)
- Built In varibles (blockDim, blockIdx, threadIdx)
- Functions provided by the CUDA API (eg. cudaMalloc, cudaFree, cudaMemcpy)
